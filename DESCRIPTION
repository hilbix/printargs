There is printenv, but no corresponding printargs.  /bin/echo doesn't
do the job, as it has options and you cannot tell if args have blanks
or not.

Actually, it does print a little bit more than just args and was
designed for easy shell usage for argument manipulation and
transmitting.

The output can be parsed by bourne shells again and is splitted onto
stdout and stderr, such that you can use following code to save the
arguments into a single line:

<pre>
saveargs="`printargs args... 2>/dev/null`"
...
eval cmd $saveargs
</pre>

The full output can be parsed as follows.  However you must be
prepared that future versions may add more information right before
the arg0 line:

<pre>
printargs args... 2>&1 |
while read -r what arg
do
	eval data="$arg"
	...
done
</pre>

Note that printargs prints linefeeds to stderr and not stdout.  This
behavior is intentional to be able to concatenate argument lists on
stdout from a loop.

Also note that printargs does not pad arguments with blanks at the
beginning nor at the end, so you have to add these blanks yourself.

In args chars $, ' and blanks are escaped such that you can easily
remove those ANSI sequence characters with '| tr -d "\' \$"'.  This
feature is intentional with a little readability tradeoff.
